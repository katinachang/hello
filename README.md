If I was not limited by time, technology, or money, I would make a device that can accurately capture a person's imagination and digitize it using AI. The device would be some sort of hat or helmet that detects brain signals and translates those signals into images.  The intention of this device is to be used by artists and designers to facilitate the making of their inventions. The digitized images can even be the artworks themselves. 

This device would be useful for designers and artists that work with 3D mediums such as sculptors, architects, industrial designers, etc. Instead of spending hours drafting and sketching, the user can simply imagine their design and the AI can interpret it in real time. These files can be opened in several programs such as Photoshop, Rhino, Blender, etc. to allow the artists the freedom to edit and refine the images. It would greatly speed up design processes that would otherwise take several days, weeks, or months to develop.

Similar to the way some machines can interpret and create art using a user's brainwaves while listening to music, this machine uses imagery instead of sound. Because of this, this device could potentially be used to record dreams. It would require a lot of testing and volunteers to refine the technology. One of the problems that may arise is whether it would work with people who have aphantasia—the inability of visualize imagery—or what those images would even look like.
